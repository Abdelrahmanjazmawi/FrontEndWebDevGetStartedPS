Front End Web Development: Get Started
==========================

Currently the course is a bit out of date, but still very relevant. 

Things that are somewhat out of date:

parts about browser dev tools. They have changed a bit, but the basics are still the same.

multi browser testing. Quite a few new options here besides what I show.

Module Systems. Mostly up to date, but there is definitely a lot of movement in this area

Libraries and tools. This is pretty out of date. Much of this has changed. Bower & Modernizr are less used now. MVC frameworks section is quite out of date, that changes on almost a daily basis.

The rest of the course is still just as applicable today as when it was published.
